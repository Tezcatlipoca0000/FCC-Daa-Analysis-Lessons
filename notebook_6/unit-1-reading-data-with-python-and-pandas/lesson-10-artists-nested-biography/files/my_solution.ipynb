In 1906 he moved to Paris, where he came into contact with such artists as Pablo Picasso and Constantin Brâncuși.

The term 'Impressionism' is derived from the title of his painting Impression, soleil levant (Impression, Sunrise), which was exhibited in 1874 in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light and the passing of the seasons. From 1883, Monet lived in Giverny, where he purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping project which included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. In 1899, he began painting the water lilies, first in vertical views with a Japanese bridge as a central feature and later in the series of large-scale paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life.\", 'wikipedia': 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet', 'paintings': 73}]}, {'name': 'Rene Magritte', 'years': '1898 - 1967', 'genre': 'Surrealism,Impressionism', 'nationality': 'Belgian', 'bio': [{'full name': 'René François Ghislain Magritte', 'pronunciation': '[ʁəne fʁɑ̃swa ɡilɛ̃ maɡʁit]', 'life span': '21 November 1898 – 15 August 1967', 'info': \"Was a Belgian Surrealist artist.
